You can find the DNS settings in the Web Panel of your Hoster / Domain seller!

DNS Settings:
@                       A               server_ip
*                       A               server_ip
@                       MX 0            mail.yourdomain.com.
@                       TXT             v=spf1 a:mail.yourdomain.com ?all
_dmarc                  TXT             v=DMARC1; p=reject;

Important!
It takes 24 up to 48 hours until the DNS Records from your Domain / Server are known in the internet!
Without valid and KNOWN DNS Records, you are not able to use this Script!
